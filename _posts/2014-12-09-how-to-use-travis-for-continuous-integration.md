title: "How to use Travis CI for continuous integration of Android projects developed by Eclipse"

## Why

[Travis CI][1] is a wonderful continuous integration service and highly integrated to Github, It supports many popular programming languages, and basically we can rewrite the build scrips to guide __Travis CI__ to build our projects. More details can be found in its [official page][2]

## TravisCI_Demo_For_Android_EclipseADT

To learn how to use Travis CI, I created a repository which includes 2 Android projects called [TravisCI_Demo_For_Android_EclipseADT][3]:

1. [Demo-Layout][4], which demonstrates layout stuff of Android.
2. [Demo-Service][5], which demostrates Service component of Android

This is a demo demonstrates how to use Travis CI for Android projects developed in Eclipse ADT, including .travis.yml sample

## Note

1. More projects in one repository is supported.
2. Each projects must has its own build.xml script for __Ant__, and build.xml can be generated by Eclipse by:
	- Right click the project node in Eclipse.
	- Click Export, and in "General" node of the popped up window, select "Ant Buildfiles".
	- Next to finish

3. The SDK path should be using environment paraments (full path), not relative path. please refer to one build.xml file in this repository.
4. Build sequence defined in __.travis.yml__ should be according to the dependency relationship of these projects.
5. Travis CI will build our repository once there is a commit via web-hook, we can skip one by including "[ci skip]" or "[skip ci]" anywhere in our commit message if we want to skip one, in case we just modified README.md for example. Pretty sweet I would say. 

## Final word

Once the build from Travis CI passed, the repository using it will get an reward of below picture:
